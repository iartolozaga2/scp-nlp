The SCP Foundation is a fictional secret organization that handles entities threatening to human life, and is documented by the collaborative writing wiki project of the same name. This wiki consists of pages for different threatening entities that the foundation handles classified by their danger level. In this project, we try to predict the danger level (called Object Class officially) just with the wiki page content of an SCP entityâ€™s wiki page. We scrape data from the SCP Wikia website. We process the aforementioned sections of the text with different tokenizers and train different Naive Bayes-based models with it.
